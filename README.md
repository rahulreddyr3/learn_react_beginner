# How this works.
* Each section is in a branch. Run the following to see all sections.
```shell
git branch
```
* Go to the section by switching to that branch
```shell
git checkout branch-name
```
* Once inside the section, progress through it by going through commits.
```shell
git checkout first-commit-sha # go to the first commit
git checkout Head^1 # move one commit forward in commit history
```
