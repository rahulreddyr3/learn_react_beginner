# Basic Intro

### Let's start with JS
* We can just use vanilla JS with html and css to create arbitrarily complex websites.
* Check the example.

### Doing things JS way
* To do thing in pure JS way, we need to create a html file and link our js file to it.

### Let's build things
* Now that the JS is linked to HTML, lets
    * Add a few elements to HTML and change them from JS.
    * Let's try to add CSS

* Now that thing can be changed, let make thing interactive

### What's next?
* Now that we know how to manipulate thing and make them interactive. Let's build a sample todos app.
  * For this let's create the required HTML elements and build in app.js
