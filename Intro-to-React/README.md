# Basic Intro to React

### Why React Recap:

* Apart from the benefits of code structure and logic segregation we discussed, react also has benefits of
* The Dom manipulation with vanilla JS is very slow and to do anything in vanilla JS we need to do DOM manipulations.
* The Data in vanilla JS is all in HTMl, when every we want to know the state of an element we need to reach to HTML and pull the element, this is slow. Whereas in react the data/state is JS data. This make things very fast.
* Easy component re-usability.

### How to do React
* In this we will see how to do the same thing we did before with react.

** Note: ** Not covering installation

* We can create a basic react app just by one command

```shell
npx create-react-app project-name
```
* This command does a lot of thing to set up react. Will to through how react works and what this setup does in next part.
* After this, we should be able to start server by
```shell
npm start
```
